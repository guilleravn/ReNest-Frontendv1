# Agent notes

Shared log between the issue-implementer and qa-reviewer agents, and context for the user and
future runs. Only what is relevant and **not already in the plan or the issue**: deviations,
decisions taken, risks, open questions. Newest first.

- Routes and shells mirror the reference app (see architecture.md "Routes" / "App shell").
  `/listings/new` and `/listings/[listingId]` stay under `(tabs)`, as in the reference; their
  inner sub-header (back to `/listings`) belongs to those pages, not to the shell.
- Nav badges (`scheduledPurchasesCount`, `listingsInProgressCount`) and the avatar initial are
  optional props, never hardcoded. Layouts don't pass them until the backend has endpoints
  (open question in architecture.md). Meanings inferred from the reference: purchases with a
  scheduled pickup, and listings with a sale in progress.
- Icons are inline SVG copies (`components/layout/icons.tsx`) instead of adding `lucide-react`.
- The avatar is not interactive yet: the account menu (logout) comes with the login flow.
- `<html lang>` switched to `es`, since the UI copy is Spanish.
- The previous port of `feat/app-shell` (branch `feat/layout`) is kept in `git stash` as
  "feat/layout: previous app shell port", not reused.
